# Pakistan Election Visualization Project

Welcome to the Pakistan Election Visualization project! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that utilizes Python and machine learning models, particularly logistic regression, to analyze election data from 1997 to 2018. 

## Project Overview
Elections are a crucial aspect of democracy, and through this project, we aim to visualize and explore Pakistan's electoral trends over two decades. The Jupyter notebook presents various data visualizations and insightful analysis, providing a deeper understanding of electoral patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project spans election results from 1997 to 2018, offering comprehensive coverage of Pakistan's political landscape during this period.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)
